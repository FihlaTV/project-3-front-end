###What is Pet Sitters?

  Wanting one's pets to be cared for by someone else who loves pets is often a concern for people leaving their home for a short period of time.
  Pet Sitters aims to alleviate this issue by providing a service for homeowners seeking carers for their pets and people looking for a stay in a home with pets. 
  As a member of Pet Sitters sitters are able to search for and contact potential homeowners for a stay and vice versa enabling users to get in contact with each other.

* Admin functionality.
* Identity verification via a plugin such as Jumio.
* A more enhanced search functionality where a user could search for a property by the number of bedrooms or type of property.
* Chat functionality using Sockets.
* Getting a user search function implemented.
